- **Modular Structure**: Each data source in separate modules with common interfaces

### 2. **Database Design Excellence**
- **Modern ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with proper declarative base and relationships
- **Migration Management**: Alembic properly configured with version control
- **Strategic Indexing**: Optimized indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints and nullable/non-nullable fields
- **Unified Data Model**: `HealthMetricUnified` table supports unlimited data sources

### 3. **API Design Standards**
- **RESTful Design**: Consistent endpoint naming and HTTP methods
- **API Versioning**: Versioned under `/api/v1/` for future compatibility
- **Auto-Documentation**: FastAPI auto-documentation with proper schemas
- **Response Models**: Comprehensive Pydantic schemas for validation

### 4. **Multi-Source Integration Architecture**
- **Flexible Data Sources**: Support for OAuth2, file upload, and manual entry
- **User Preferences**: Configurable data source priorities per category
- **Background Processing**: Async file processing with job tracking
- **Quality Scoring**: Data quality indicators for reliability assessment

### 5. **Configuration Management**
- **Environment-Based**: Pydantic Settings with environment variable support
- **Centralized**: Single configuration file with all service configurations
- **Security**: Proper handling of secrets through environment variables

## üîß Improvements Implemented During Analysis

### 1. **Enhanced Security & Middleware**
```python
# Added comprehensive middleware stack
- SecurityHeadersMiddleware: HSTS, XSS protection, content type options
- RequestLoggingMiddleware: Correlation IDs, request/response timing
- RateLimitMiddleware: In-memory rate limiting (Redis recommended for production)
```

### 2. **Monitoring & Observability**
```python
# Added health check endpoints
/health          # Basic health check
/health/detailed # Database connectivity + configuration validation
/health/ready    # Kubernetes readiness probe
/health/live     # Kubernetes liveness probe
```

### 3. **Structured Logging**
```python
# Comprehensive logging configuration
- Correlation ID tracking across requests
- Rotating file handlers for app and error logs
- Structured logging with JSON formatter support
- Proper log levels for different components
```

### 4. **Exception Handling**
```python
# Global exception handlers
- HTTP exception handler with correlation ID tracking
- Global exception handler for unhandled errors
- Proper error logging with context
```
