# Frontend

## Overview

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides dashboards, charts, and a chat interface for health analytics.

## Structure

- **Components**: Modular React components for metrics, charts, chat, and settings
- **State Management**: Context API and custom hooks
- **Services**: API calls, authentication, data fetching
- **Assets**: Static files and styles

## Key Patterns

- Functional components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive design

See `architecture.md` for how frontend fits into the system.
