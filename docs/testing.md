# Testing

## Overview

Testing ensures reliability and maintainability for both backend and frontend.

## Backend
- Use `pytest` for unit and integration tests
- Coverage reporting with `pytest-cov`
- Test database setup for isolation

## Frontend
- Use `Jest` and `React Testing Library`
- Component and integration tests
- Mock API calls

## CI Integration
- Run tests on every PR/commit (CI setup TBD)

## Best Practices
- Write tests for new features and bugfixes
- Maintain high coverage
- Use fixtures and mocks for isolation
