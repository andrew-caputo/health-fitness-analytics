# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The health and fitness tracking landscape is fragmented across multiple platforms and devices. Users are forced to choose between different ecosystems (Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Withings, etc.) without the ability to combine data from their preferred sources. This project creates a universal health data integration platform that gives users complete control over their health data sources.

## Problems We Solve

### 1. Data Source Lock-in
**Problem**: Users are locked into single ecosystems and can't combine data from multiple preferred sources.
**Solution**: Universal integration platform supporting 9 major health data sources with user-selectable preferences per health category.

### 2. Incomplete Health Picture
**Problem**: No single device or app provides comprehensive coverage across Activity, Sleep, Nutrition, and Body Composition.
**Solution**: Multi-source data aggregation allowing users to select the best source for each health category.

### 3. Limited Data Portability
**Problem**: Health data is trapped in proprietary formats and platforms.
**Solution**: Unified data model with standardized metrics across all sources, plus CSV import/export capabilities.

### 4. Lack of Cross-Source Insights
**Problem**: Existing platforms only analyze data from their own ecosystem.
**Solution**: AI-powered insights that correlate data across multiple sources for comprehensive health understanding.

## How It Works
