# Progress

## Current Status
Database and migration setup complete. Backend container now runs with all dependencies using Poetry. FastAPI is available in the Poetry environment. All endpoints are visible in the docs and import issues are resolved. All endpoint linter issues (B008, argument order) are resolved. Linter/ruff is not reporting issues for endpoints, but backend directory may have a file system or environment issue.

## What Works
- Docker Compose launches PostgreSQL database
- Alembic is configured and working
- Initial tables (`users`, `health_metrics`, `user_goals`) created
- Backend and frontend scaffolding in place
- Backend container runs with all dependencies using Poetry
- All API endpoints are visible and operational in FastAPI docs
- Absolute imports are now used throughout the backend
- All endpoint linter issues (B008, argument order) are resolved

## Troubleshooting Steps
- Resolved Docker authentication and image pull issues by logging in and restarting Docker Desktop
- Fixed Alembic configuration errors by ensuring `script_location` and correct `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini`
- Created missing `alembic/versions` directory to resolve migration script errors
- Ensured port mapping for PostgreSQL in `docker-compose.yml`
- Resolved FastAPI not found in container by:
  - Removing backend volume mount in docker-compose.yml
  - Using Poetry for dependency management in Dockerfile
  - Verifying FastAPI is available with 'poetry run python' in the container
- Fixed all import errors and enforced absolute imports
- All endpoint linter issues (B008, argument order) are resolved

## What's Left to Build
- Investigate and resolve backend directory/linter access issue
- Address remaining linter/code quality issues in backend
- Endpoint testing in Swagger UI
- Implement authentication
- Add data ingestion endpoints (Apple Health, Withings, CSV)
- Build frontend dashboard and data visualization
- Integrate OpenAI for AI assistant
- Add tests and CI/CD pipeline

## Next Actions
1. Investigate and resolve backend directory/linter access issue
2. Fix remaining linter/code issues
3. Scaffold backend API endpoints
4. Connect frontend to backend
5. Begin AI assistant integration
6. Add tests and CI/CD
