2. **End-to-End System Verification**:
   - ✅ **iOS Login Success**: User can successfully authenticate with test credentials
   - ✅ **Backend API**: All 17 AI endpoints + authentication endpoints operational
   - ✅ **Database Storage**: Health metrics properly stored with correct schema
   - ✅ **Real-time Dashboard**: iOS app displays live health data from backend
   - ✅ **Sync Status**: Complete bidirectional data synchronization working

3. **Professional iOS App Architecture** (Migrated from temp_complex_features):
   - ✅ **Clean Folder Structure**: Proper iOS app organization with logical grouping
   - ✅ **Advanced AI Features**: Complete dashboard with health scoring and insights
   - ✅ **Goal Management System**: Progress tracking with AI-powered recommendations
   - ✅ **Achievement Engine**: Badges, streaks, celebrations, and milestones
   - ✅ **Health Coaching**: Personalized behavioral interventions
   - ✅ **Privacy Controls**: Comprehensive data privacy and permission management
   - ✅ **Connected Apps**: Detailed integration management and data source priority

4. **Code Quality & Organization**:
   - ✅ **Resolved All Build Errors**: From 115+ errors to successful build
   - ✅ **Eliminated Duplicates**: Consolidated models into single source of truth
   - ✅ **Professional Architecture**: Clean MVVM pattern with proper separation
   - ✅ **Backup Cleanup**: ios-app-backup safely removed after successful migration
