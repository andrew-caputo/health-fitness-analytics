# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Backend containerization and dependency management with Poetry and Docker
- FastAPI backend is running, all endpoints are visible in docs
- Absolute imports are now used throughout the backend
- All endpoint linter issues (B008, argument order) are resolved
- Linter/ruff is not reporting issues for endpoints, but backend directory may have a file system or environment issue
- Preparing to address remaining linter/code quality issues in backend, then proceed to endpoint testing and code quality improvements

## Recent Changes
- Docker Compose launches PostgreSQL database
- Alembic migration system configured and working
- Initial tables created in database
- Docker/Poetry/FastAPI integration issues resolved
- All import issues fixed; absolute imports enforced
- Backend container now runs with all dependencies and all endpoints registered
- Linter (ruff) run: 137 issues found (import sorting, unused imports, line length, function argument patterns, etc.)
- All endpoint linter issues (B008, argument order) resolved

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and resolve backend directory/linter access issue
2. Address remaining linter/code quality issues in backend
3. Proceed with endpoint testing in Swagger UI
4. Continue with feature development and frontend integration

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring robust API design
- Planning for secure authentication
- Designing flexible data ingestion
- Coordinating backend and frontend development
- Addressing code quality and linter issues

## Next Milestone Goals
1. CRUD API endpoints operational and tested
2. Frontend dashboard displays live data
3. AI assistant chat interface scaffolded
4. End-to-end data flow from ingestion to visualization
